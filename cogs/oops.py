    the bot stores the message for each channel separately.

            therefore, user is able to delete more than one last bot message.
        using this command on one channel will not delete a message from another channel.
    users will not be able to delete a bot messages made by other users.
    data structure used to store past message is a python dictionary.
        dict (key = user's discord id, value = dict (key = channel id, value = array[message])).
    a 'no messages to delete' error message will be displayed:
